## Build stage: Your output at this stage should be a zipped-up Lambda function artifact and a config file ready to deploy your resources.
## Deploy stage: Run your IaC tool to deploy the resources in AWS.
## Smoke test stage: Run your Cypress (or Playwright) API tests to make sure the deployed API does what you think it should.
